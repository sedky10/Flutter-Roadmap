![Flutter Dash Character: we are very excited to have you on board!](assets/images/dash-flutter.jpg "Flutter Dash Character")
>This roadmap was created for the Flutter committee in IEEE Mansoura Computer Society Chapter by Omar Nabil Elmesiry & Upgraded by Mahmoud Sedky, heads of the committee. I hope you get the most benefit from it. Also, I would like to thank [Code2Start](https://www.youtube.com/@Code2Start) , [Omar Ahmed](https://www.youtube.com/@OmarAhmedx14) and [Wael Abu Hamza](https://www.youtube.com/@WaelabohamzaFlutter) channels very much for the amazing content provided that I built most of the roadmap on. Don't waste any time, let's get started!

## Objectives:

The main goal for this committee is to prepare committee members for being able to work as a Flutter Developer, either in a company or as a freelancer. In order to achieve this main goal, we have to the following objectives to focus on:

- Building active cooperative environment that enables everyone to communicate his/her ideas, opinions, work, or anything the member would like to share in a professional formal manner.
- Building active individuals that have advanced public speaking skills, advanced researching and self learning skills, and advanced writing skills, especially when writing about projects or technical concepts.
- Advancing in basic programming concepts, OOP for example, and essential methodologies such as Clean Code.
- Advancing in basic and intermediate flutter concepts that are essential for building full simple and intermediate mobile apps.
- Introduction to some advanced software development concepts such as Clean Architecture and Design patterns.
- Building projects portfolio from different projects starting from the advanced level, some of the projects will be as individuals and others will be in teams.
